Hey This is me Learning ML(Collective Intelligence) using the book Programming Collective Intelligence by Toby Segaran.

Structure :
    All the functions are in functions.py
    The dataset is in recommendation.py
    run the functions using main.py


DAY 1: 
Understand what is Collective Intelligence.
Start building a movie recommndation program where it evaluates simillarity scores based on movie critic scores and users score and then recommends movies that user havent watched but may like based on his past movie reviews.

Pearson Corelation Score : 
    \(r=\frac{n\sum xy-(\sum x)(\sum y)}{\sqrt{[n\sum x^{2}-(\sum x)^{2}][n\sum y^{2}-(\sum y)^{2}]}}\)


Day something

    See how changing the people with movies in product solves a very interesting probelm, 
    say anyone wants to find similar movies based how different critics have scored the running the same simimalrity functions on inverted pref dictionary actually helps finding this.
    Also if anyone wants to find recommended critics for a new movie one can run getrecommendation function on the inverted dictionary. Cool Stuff
    Same can be done for Products in a grocerry think deeply.
